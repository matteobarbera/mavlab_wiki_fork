# Starting your MSc Thesis

The purpose of this page is to explain the process of the MSc thesis, as well as the administrative side, such that you can focus on the content with your supervisor.

## Exemption knowledge embargo
The first thing to do when you know you want to graduate at C&S, is to ask for an exemption for the knowledge embargo that the government put in place.
You **must** ask an exemption to study at the section Control and Simulation, so do this as soon as you can, since they will need some time to check your background. Information can be found in [Dutch](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/wetten-en-regelingen/productbeschrijvingen/ontheffing-kennisembargo-voor-bepaalde-technische-en-nucleaire-studies) and [English](https://www.government.nl/topics/secondary-vocational-education-mbo-and-higher-education/exemption-certain-engineering-or-nuclear-related-courses-of-study/request-a-knowledge-embargo-exemption-for-technical-and-nuclear-studies).
