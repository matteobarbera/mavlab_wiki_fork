# Starting your MSc Thesis

The purpose of this page is to explain the process of the MSc thesis, as well as the administrative side, such that you can focus on the content with your supervisor.

## Exemption knowledge embargo
The first thing to do when you know you want to graduate at C&S, is to ask for an exemption for the knowledge embargo that the government put in place.
You **must** ask an exemption to study at the section Control and Simulation, so do this as soon as you can, since the government will need some time to check your background. Information can be found in [Dutch](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/wetten-en-regelingen/productbeschrijvingen/ontheffing-kennisembargo-voor-bepaalde-technische-en-nucleaire-studies) and [English](https://www.government.nl/topics/secondary-vocational-education-mbo-and-higher-education/exemption-certain-engineering-or-nuclear-related-courses-of-study/request-a-knowledge-embargo-exemption-for-technical-and-nuclear-studies).

## Procedure and Rules

Your thesis will take 38 weeks (~9 months). A rough outline can be found [here](https://www.tudelft.nl/studenten/faculteiten/lr-studentenportal/onderwijs/master/thesis) and on the [CS wiki](https://cs.lr.tudelft.nl/education/msc-thesis-2/).

There are [rubrics](https://d1rkab7tlqy5f1.cloudfront.net/Studentenportal/Faculteitspecifiek/LR/Onderwijs/2.pdf) according to which your thesis will be assessed.

## Literature Study

The first part of your thesis will be a literature study.
You need to look for papers and books that provide background information on the topic and give insight into how others have tried to tackle the research problem. Finally, you need to identify a *knowledge gap*.

The literature study will be assessed and graded by your supervisor.
The rubrics for the literature study can be found [here](https://d1rkab7tlqy5f1.cloudfront.net/Studentenportal/Faculteitspecifiek/LR/Onderwijs/Ae_-_Literature_Survey_-_Rubrics.pdf).

### Research Methodologies
You also need to do the course 'research methodologies'.
It makes sense to do this course during your literature study, as this will allow you to kill two birds with one stone.
