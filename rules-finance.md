# Buying hardware 

# Where
TUDelft has a list of preferred suppliers. **If you can buy** at those supplier **you must** and no other supplier. Call finance 88622 (phone number is on the phone in the MAVLab).

## Farnell

One of the preferred suppliers is [Farnell](http://www.farnell.nl), a very large supplier of electronic supplies. The MAVLab orders a large part of its supplies here. If ordered before 18:00 your order will arrive the next day, for free. The MAVLab has a special https://alusta.tudelft.nl/ shop account. If you need to order there but have no access ask fellow workers in the lab if they can help ordering for you.

# Declarations

Of all things you buy, you **must** **KEEP** a hardcopy of the receipt! The Lab is obliged to be able to show all receipts of any payment/purchase at a request for 3 years. If you have your own registration, keep it in there in reference to the declaration code (DECLxxxxxxB or LxxxxxxB) and the date. If you are unable to or are a very unorganized person, bring all your hard copies to Christophe De Wagter. He will save it for you in the MAVLab administration.

## MAVLab expenses sheet

All expenses are being tracked for each project code ('baancode') in an [online Excel sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rjMwl2PAkqQoZJo79XyGppT0GmYS0PzrqwRbRjkukpM/edit?usp=sharing). Whenever you make an expense, you have to fill this information in this sheet. This is **very** important as otherwise, we don't have any idea how much budget is left on each project code, as information from the finance department always runs behind at least half a year.

The sheet also helps you to keep track of your declarations and can send you a reminder if you have non-declared expenses for too long.

# Ordering through Finance

Chances are, if you work in the MAVLab at some point you will need to order parts, tools, or other lab equipment. To do so you can pay for the parts yourself and be reimbursed by the finance department. This is the quickest way to place orders, but this method opens the buyer up to a period of financial strain while the finance department processes the reimbursement. To avoid spending your own money there are two other ways to place orders using C1 or C5 forms.

# C5 Forms:

TL;DR
* Download and fill out C5 form.
* Get it signed by Bertine Markus.
* Contact supplier and ask for Pro Forma invoice, no VAT, using VAT ID: NL001.569.569.B01
* Scan signed form and email with Pro Forma invoice to inkoop-finance@tudelft.nl
* Check that you and supplier have received a purchase order and **invoice** via email.
* Email and call finance every day until the part arrives. Try to work with the same person for continuity’s sake.


This is the standard way to place an order with finance. Download a C5 form, complete it, and print it. If the order is for less than €1000 then Bertine Markus can approve the form, if not, it must be approved by her supervisor. Take the printed form to Bertine and get the necessary signature. She is not always in her office, but she tends to be present earlier in the day and is very friendly. 

After obtaining the necessary signatures, scan the form and convert it to a PDF. If you are ordering from multiple suppliers, do not combine the images into a single PDF.  Email the scans to inkoop-finance@tudelft.nl with a quick note stressing that it is important your order is processed as soon as possible. At this point, the order will enter the finance department’s program. It may stagnate here for up to 30 days before the finance department contacts the supplier.

If there is time pressure for your order, make the finance department feel that pressure. Without being rude, pester them as much as possible. A quick email to the original person who processed your order, not the department, daily can help establish continuity and encourage expediency. Additionally, actually visiting the department, located in the Civil Engineering building, can really help to speed things up. 

Further understanding of the finance department’s procedures can also accelerate the ordering process.  The department uses Pro Forma invoices from companies to make payments. If you contact your desired supplier after getting your C5 signed, you can request a Pro Forma invoice. Simply let the company know what you want, give them shipping and billing information (billing information of the university), and request that VAT be waived as per the educational status of the university. To achieve this last point you will need to share the university’s VAT ID: NL001.569.569.B01. Beginning your contact with inkoop-finance@tudelft with a signed C5 and Pro Forma invoice will greatly decrease the turn around time for orders.

# C1 Forms:
 
TL;DR
* Download and fill out C1 form (ensure that you toggle it to the correct version).
* Get it signed by Bertine Markus.
* Scan signed form and email it to liquiditeiten-finance@tudelft.nl 
* Go to Civil Engineering Bldg, Floor 5, Rm 5.79 to meet with finance and oversee order.

C1 forms are a much quicker route to placing an order than C5 forms. However, they are only to be used in cases where credit cards are the only available method of payment with the supplier. (see the example in the attachment)

Simply download a C1 form, fill it out, and have it signed by either Bertine or her supervisor. Scan the signed document, and email it to liquiditeiten-finance@tudelft.nl. In your email establish a meeting time with this sub-sect of the finance department. You will need to go to the Civil Engineering building and oversee the purchase. Be sure to bring the hard copy of the exact same document that you sent in your email. The department can be a bit funny and requires both hard and digital copies.
