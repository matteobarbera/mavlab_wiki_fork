# MAVLab Introduction page

Welcome to the [MAVLab](http://mavlab.tudelft.nl/) !

The most important stuff you should know are the lab rules and regulations. It is mandatory that you have read and understood this section before you can start your work at the lab.

# Summary
## Cleaning policy
Clean up your desk every Friday. This means completely empty. 

## Which airframes can I take? =

1. Ask Erik when you want to use a specific airframe 
1. He will give you the airframe and register it to your name, 
1. Put a sticker with your name on it on the drone.
 
When something on your aircraft breaks, create a system report in the MAVLab app.

https://github.com/tudelft/mavlab_admin/blob/master/MavLabManager_r10.apk

If you can repair the aircraft yourself, please do so. Ask for the parts in the lab. Otherwise you can ask Erik. 

# Rules

Next to that, there are also pages that inform you on things like:

- systems and rules on sharing and backing up your work
- how to use hardware like drones and batteries
- how buying new stuff works
- who to approach when you have certain questions
- etc.

So let's start with the most important.

# Lab Rules & Regulations = #LabRules

For most tests and experiments you use potentially dangerous hardware which could hurt people or damage property. Think of fast spinning blades or batteries containing big charges that introduce fire hazzard when improperly used. It is therefore very important to know the rules in our lab.

When working with hardware, you will be doing your work in one of three locations: the main MAVLAB, the manufacturing lab (also called in Dutch *het freeshok*) or the CyberZoo, located in the aircraft hall (*de vliegtuighal*).

The first two are run by the MAVLAB, but with the CyberZoo we are a guest in the aircraft hall, so additional safety rules apply.

## Main MAVLAB

### Getting Access to the MAVLab Room

To get access to the main MAVLab room, e-mail Bertine Markus (secretary of the Control & Simulation department) at B.M.Markus@tudelft.nl. Send a photocopy of your student card, your phone number and until when you want to have access. She will reply with when you can drop off your card to have it activated.

### MAVLAB Rules

* **Leave a clean desk at the end of the day**

We have a clean desk policy. This means at the end of your day clean all the stuff you have used. It can be you are working on a project and you will be in first thing in the morning. It is okay to leave your stuff on a desk at the end of the day if you are working on it continuously. But put back all the things you used (tape, screwdrivers, multimeter, caliper, knifes, batteries, chargers etc.). This especially holds true for the soldering stations. After use, at the end of the day, put everything back and remove all garbage from the desk. Don't think *I didn't use this, I'm not gonna clean that*. We run the lab together: together we make sure the lab is a clean, safe and enjoyable workplace.

 * **Put back the stuff you used**

Don't wait till the end of the day with putting your stuff back. If you are finished with something, put it back immediately. This way less stuff 'mysteriously disappears', and your colleagues can also use it. One of the biggest losses of time (and increase in frustration level), is running around all day trying to find the right equipment, when it turns out to be lying on your colleague's desk doing nothing.

 * **If you are the last to leave, turn off the power-banks at the soldering stations.**

 * **Do not leave batteries unattended when charging them.** 

Make sure there is always somebody around when charging, and let them know you are charging.

## Cyberzoo

### Getting Access to the Cyberzoo
Getting access to the Cyberzoo requires contacting the administration of the Aerospace Structures and Materials department in order to get the card activated. The current secretary to contact is Gemma van der Windt (G.J.M.vanderWindt@tudelft.nl).

Normal access to the Aircraft hall is restricted to until 6pm and only on work-days. Furthermore, you can only enter from the main entrance.

It is possible to get extended access. This will give you access after 6pm and on weekends, and will allow you to use the back entrance, which is handy. You can ask for this extension by sending another e-mail to the secretary, but restrictions may apply for BSc/MSc students.

### General Rules
The CyberZoo is located in the Aircraft Hall. Therefore, it is **mandatory** to familiarize yourself with the safety rules:

* [Aircraft Hall Safety Rules (English)](https://d1rkab7tlqy5f1.cloudfront.net/LR/Organisatie/Afdelingen/Department_Aerospace_Structures_and_Materials/DASLM/safety/Safety%20regulations%20%282017_2%29.pdf)
* [Aircraft Hall Safety Rules (Dutch)](https://d1rkab7tlqy5f1.cloudfront.net/LR/Organisatie/Afdelingen/Department_Aerospace_Structures_and_Materials/DASLM/safety/Alg.%20Veiligheidsregels%20%282017_2%29.pdf)

When you are in the CyberZoo the following rules apply:

1. Always wear closed shoes (This rule applies to the whole aircraft hall in general, see above document). If you ignore this rule then you will likely be asked to leave by the personnel.
2. Carefully read the safety rules that are posted in and around the zoo .
3. Never walk alone in the the aircraft hall. You must always be accompanied by another person when working at the CyberZoo.
4. Do not leave any objects outside of the CyberZoo. Remember we are guests in the aircraft hall and share the area with other users.
5. Keep the desks clean and tidy.
6. **Do not torrent when in the Cyberzoo**. As you may know, torrenting and the like are against TU Delft policy. When in the Cyberzoo, you may be able to connect to the Internet via a LAN cable or dedicated router that do not require a password. If you are torrenting with this, it will disable Internet for the entire Cyberzoo and everyone there, and possibly have repercussions on the account holder for the Cyberzoo. Make sure that all your activities are within TU Delft policy.
7. Don't make a mess of the CyberZoo. Clean/tidy up after you have used the facility.
8. **Never** leave drones/transmitters/joysticks/laptops unattended. Many people have access to the hall, and we seem to 'loose' a lot of stuff, so make sure passers-by don't get tempted!

### Booking time in the Cyberzoo for your experiment
As you may imagine, many people want to use the Cyberzoo. We have a Google Calendar where you can check when the time is free or make a reservation for when you would like to use it. Ask your supervisor to be added to this calendar.

### Using the Cyberzoo
Using the Cyberzoo properly requires you to get acquainted with a few things. Find out more at the [Cyberzoo page](../cyberzoo).

# Finance = #how

There are strict rules and guidelines about finance. We buy a lot of stuff as a Lab, so proper administration is important, both for us directly and for keeping the finance department satisfied.

## Buying hardware

TUDelft has a list of "preferred suppliers". If you can buy there you must. Call finance 88622 (phone number is on the phone in the MAVLab).

## Farnell
One of the preferred suppliers is [Farnell](http://www.farnell.nl), a very large supplier of electronic supplies. The MAVLab orders a large part of its supplies here. If ordered before 18:00 your order will arrive the next day, for free. The MAVLab has an account there under the name of Christophe de Wagter. Ask around if you need to have the login information.


## Declarations

Of all things you buy, you **must KEEP** a hardcopy of the receipt! The Lab is obliged to be able to show all receipts of any payment/purchase at request for 3 years. If you have your own registration, keep it in there in reference to the declaration code (DECLxxxxxxB or LxxxxxxB) and the date. If you are unable to, or are a very unorganized person, bring all your hardcopies to Christophe De Wagter. He will save it for you in the MAVLAB administration.

## MAVLab expenses sheet

All expenses are being tracked for each project code (*baancode*) in an [online Excel sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rjMwl2PAkqQoZJo79XyGppT0GmYS0PzrqwRbRjkukpM/edit?usp=sharing). Whenever you make an expense, you have to fill this information in this sheet. This is **very** important as otherwise we don't have any idea how much budget is left on each project code, as information from the finance department always runs behind at least half a year.

The sheet also helps you to keep track of your declarations, and can send you a reminder if you have non-declared expenses for too long.

# ICT resources


## MAVLab wiki - how to use

The page you are on now, is the MAVLab wiki. The idea is to provide a place where people can share and find often needed information. Whenever you do something (like calibration of a sensor, configuration of a router etc.) which is something that you or somebody else might need to do in the future again, it might be worth it to write it down so it is available for future reference.

Editing the wiki is relatively straightforward. On the top right of this page you can find two buttons: press *Edit* to make changes to the page your currently on, or press *New Page* to start a new page. Formatting of the wiki must be done using Markdown, check [this page](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to find out about all  important commands. Make sure to use *relative* links when referring to content contained in this wiki (../other_wiki_page).

## Shared Calendars
The MAVLab has two shared Google calendars that might be of interest, you can ask to be added depending on your needs:
  1. **Cyberzoo Calendar**: This is a **must** if you plan to do experiments in the Cyberzoo, so that you can reserve time to for your experiments and see when the Cyberzoo is free.
  2. **MicroUAV Calendar**: A shared calendar of activities so you know what other people in the lab are (going to be) up to. This can be very useful especially if you are very active within the lab.

## MAVLab Manager
To have a good insight in the state of our flying platforms, we use MAVLab Manager to keep track of flight times, crashes and the general condition of our UAVs and batteries.
This can be accessed at [log.mavlab.info](http://log.mavlab.info). Send a email to Erik: e.vanderhorst@tudelft.nl for him to add you to the system.

Whenever you want to use a drone, you must scan the QR code using our Android app: ​https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.mavlab.manager&hl=en.

If you don’t have an Android phone, you can do this manually with the drone ID number.
To make an account, you will need to know a "secret", which is: *group15*.

More on the MAVLab Manager can be found on the [AirframeManager page](../AirframeManager) (*Not yet available*).


## Version control

In the MAVlab, there is a lot of collaboration on shared code (Paparazzi, SmartUAV etc.). To enable this collaboration and make sure that there is always a working version of the code, we rely heavily on version control:

"Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later"

### Git

Git is a popular versioning system. It is famously used via [GitHub](http://www.github.com).

If you are unfamiliar with Git, the following is a good getting started tutorial: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started. To understand how you can use git with GitHub, you can find a few short guides [here](https://guides.github.com/).

Sometimes, using Git via the command line is not too user friendly, especially if you are trying to clearly see a history of prior code versions (a.k.a. commits).
A good tool if you are using Ubuntu is [SmartGit](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/)

We use two separate Git repositories here in the MAVLab:

* ***Paparazzi UAV*** (https://github.com/paparazzi) *Public*. Just make a free account on [Github](http://www.github.com) and you are ready to fork (make a personal copy of) this repository (or any public project, for that matter). 
* ***TUDelft*** (https://github.com/tudelft) *Private*. To get access, e-mail: c.dewagter@tudelft.nl with your account details.

### SVN

SVN is still used electronics, papers, regulations, (old micro-controller code), ...

Our SVN is located at:

 - https://svn.lr.tudelft.nl/MAVLAB/SmartUAV
 - https://svn.lr.tudelft.nl/MAVLAB/SmartUAV/Documentation/Papers/
 - https://svn.lr.tudelft.nl/MAVLAB/MavBal
 - https://svn.lr.tudelft.nl/MAVLAB/Electronics
 - https://svn.lr.tudelft.nl/MAVLAB/Regelgeving

If you need access email: c.dewagter@tudelft.nl. 

Use a program like [TortoiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.net/) (for windows) to easily access and manage the SVN.


### Photo/movies harddisk

The MAVLab has 1 GROUP drive at TUDelft (with automatic backups). http://webdata.tudelft.nl/ groups, LR, CO, MavLab. Only staff/phd can get access. Email the ServicepuntLR@tudelft.nl to request access.

There exists a harddisk for saving all photos and movies. Ask Erik for more information.

## External ICT recources

Websites/tools we usually use within the MAVlab

### Mailing lists
These are some mailing lists that can also keep you up to date:
* [euRobotics](https://lists.iais.fraunhofer.de/sympa/info/euron-dist)
* [TU Delft Robotics Institute](https://listserv.tudelft.nl/mailman/listinfo/robotics)
* [robotics-worldwide](http://duerer.usc.edu/mailman/listinfo.cgi/robotics-worldwide)


### Youtube channel

The MAVLab has its own Youtube channel. Any M.Sc./Ph.D. can get write access to upload videos directly to the group: email: c.dewagter@tudelft.nl

[MAVLAB Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGS-Ra1fPexk01KYIBeySRQ)

### Twitter

The MAVLab has a Twitter channel, announcing new achievements and cool inventions we make almost everyday. Feel free to contribute!

[MAVLAB Twitter](https://twitter.com/microuav)

### Literature tools

The academic staff and students have to keep up to date to the latest work and projects related to the topic of their project. These are some tools that can help you with that

#### Reference managers

* [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) : Most people in MAVlab use this. It enables easy storage of your PDF and extracting of metadata. Also used to share literature between groups/people
* [JabRef](http://www.jabref.org/) : Alternative reference manager. It is simpler than mendeley but it is a bibtex dedicated manager, so if you use latex a lot, it is worth a check

#### Citation Analysis

If you want to more than just listing references, you can look at these citation analysis tools:

* [CitNetExplorer](http://www.citnetexplorer.nl/) : shows the citation network between papers
* [VOSviewer](http://www.vosviewer.com/) : shows the bibliometric connection between papers/authors/groups. 

### Latex Tips
