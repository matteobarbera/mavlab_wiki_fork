The C&S section will pay for three copies of every student’s final MSc thesis (one for the C&S archive, one for the external committee member and one for yourself). This is done in cooperation with the professional print shop located in the Faculty of Architecture (CSinBKCity). In order to get your copies paid for, please follow the following instructions:

Make an account and order your prints at http://www.csinbkcity.nl
For your order, use the following print options:
A4 Laserprint
Color
Double sided
Paper: 80 grams
Front- and back cover
White back cover
Binding: glue bind (Dutch: lijmrug)
Enter (approximate) number of pages and number of copies (you can order more than three copies if you like, but you will have to pay for these additional ones yourself when you pick up your order)
Press continue and upload your thesis PDF.
In step 4, in the extra information box, add the following:
“Afstudeerverslag C&S [your name]” .
“Full bleed cover”
“Witte lijmrug” (white glue binds)
Review your order carefully and finalize with the Order button
Right before picking up your order, go by Bertine Markus’s office (Room 0.30) and ask (nicely) for the C&S thesis print card
Go to the copy shop at the Faculty of Architecture (Julianalaan 134, Delft) to pick up your order
Tell the staff at the copy shop your order is a C&S MSc. thesis and give them the print card (the staff knows how to charge the C&S department for three copies and is aware of all the instructions)
If more than three copies were ordered, pay for the additional ones yourself
Be sure to bring the print card back to Bertine after picking up your order. If Bertine is not in her office, slide the card under the door.
To make sure you will be able to hand in your thesis on time, please schedule the printing of your thesis accordingly. Please send Bertine an email (B.M.Markus@tudelft.nl) upfront to ask her for her availability for when you would like to pick up the print card. When scheduling the printing of your thesis, please keep a margin of a few days, because it might be that Bertine is not in her office for a day.

 

Also keep an eye on the STABILO Brightspace page for any temporary notifications about the thesis printing, because when Bertine is on holiday, the print card will be handed over to someone else for you to be able to pick it up. 

 

Please be so kind to follow these instructions carefully and be aware that this is a trial. If the C&S department notices that this system does not work or is being abused, this privilege might be reconsidered.

If there are any questions regarding these procedures, please write an email to stabilo-lr@tudelft.nl.
