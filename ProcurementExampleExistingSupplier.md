#Case

In the lab internally agreed was that we wanted to upgrade the motion capture system in the Windtunnel with new cameras to have reliable Pointcloud and also a vitrual GPS system inside the OJF windtunnel. For the we needed 16 camereas

So this is have we made it into a reality

#Steps we made

1. emailed the supplier first to make sure they can supply in a certain timeframe and to make us an offer we can not refuse.
The supplier responded and the price was deducted to be agreeable by us. Since this wasthe only supplier on the planet, unique device, there was no need to look for an alternative supplier.

1. Asked the supplier to email us the final offering per PDF
