## Spot welder

If you want to make your own battery packs from LiIon round cells, then you have to solve the problem of connecting the individual cells. Soldering wires to them is not an option, because the required prolonged heat at the battery tabs tends to damage the cell's inner structure.The method to interconnect the cells is to weld nickel or nickel-plated steel strips across them using a resistance **spot welder**

For this you can use this  MAVLab [KWeld device](https://www.keenlab.de/index.php/portfolio-item/kweld/)
