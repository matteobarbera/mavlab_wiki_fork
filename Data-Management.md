# Data and Code Management

This page provides guidelines on the management of data and code. New PhDs are required to set up a data management plan (DMP), which can be done using the [DMPonline](https://dmponline.tudelft.nl/) tool provided by TU Delft. Below you can find guidelines on parts of the DMP:

- Data sharing platforms
- Software licences
- Data licences
- Metadata standards

Each section contains an overview of available options, and also recommendations based on what is being used/preferred at the MAVLab. Further questions regarding management of data and code can be directed to the faculty data steward, Dr. Heather Andrews (find her email in the TU Delft webmail address book).
