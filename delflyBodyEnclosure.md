# Intro

To make the Delfly less prone to damage a solution was found by enclosing al critical part in an enclosure.

# Outcome

An extremely light simple to create rigid body for the Delfly

- This is about the result we love to see, but then created by using a female mold, not male. http://static.rcgroups.net/forums/attachments/6/8/3/3/a41860-199-migvac.jpg
- A bit like this, but then mold from MDF http://www.rcmovie.de/video/80c96e2762b5e2003cef/Yak-Tiefziehen

- and a milled like this via CNC http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liTPtn3V0xI

# Mold

Make a Female mold 

## Design

Both sides of the Delfly CNC milled from MDF via XPertMill on the MAVLab superior 1600 CNC machine

### Milling

<img src="../raw/master/images/DelflyBodyMoldv1.jpg" width="75%"/>

A 2mm bit with the bigger red spindle is used.

### Air holes

To be able to vacuum pull, air holes need to be drilled. Preferably by only a tool-change, else a 1mm drillbit on high RPM by hand with the dremel. About 1cm distance.

# Usage instructions

## Body Material 

Using 1mm  Durabatics

## Process

- Cut a piece of depron surrounding the mo;dshape with about 2 cm on all sides, not smaller not bigger
- Place Depron or durabatics on mold with smooth side towards the mold
- Drape heat resistant plastic over the depron about 6 cm wider on all side thant the depon piece
- Vacuum emergency vent to open
- With geatgun on 7 and amaint of air on 2, preheat with about 5 cm ditance with continuos movment
- after 15 secons preheating, swith on vacuum on low setting while continue with adding heath
- continue heating and in about 5 secons to full vacuum
- Close emergeny vent
- when all is suckedinto the mold, stop the heading of the depron
- set vacuum to mid position
- wait 10 seconds, 
- turn off vacuum completely
- cooloff the depron and cover with air from 40cm distance for 10 seconds
- remove piece from mold

### Heating

The heating times in the infrared oven were varied from 17 to 23 s, leading to surface temperatures from 100 to 111 [degrees] C. The sheet thickness distribution was only slightly flatter for the lowest temperature. 

### Vacuum + Heat

The moldvacuum is switched on as soon as the temperature is in the correct range.
The (relative) vacuum pressure was varied from -51 kPa to -85 kPa.

The effect of the different pressures on the thickness distributions was negligible. Also for the different sheet directions little difference was found in the thickness distributions. Only in the regions with low strains, the thickness along the extrusion direction was slightly lower than along the transverse direction.

### Cooling

Cooling appeared to be the only process parameter with significant effect (within the applicable range). Using a cooling time shorter than 1 s led to insufficient solidification of the products, visible as surface defects or in a worse case malformed

# Reorganize this

The depron can deform easily if head is heat added. The difficulty of deep drawing, however, is that the material is deformed not only, but also stretched. with my new method, the material is not stretched, but formed only a template.

- shaping of the hull mold attached to a building board
-a piece of depron zuchneiden with something about mass and place it on the form
-everything in a vacuum bag
Connect push-pump un the whole story in the oven
now-warm things slowly and slowly (!) suck the air.

This will call the depron curved shape on the need to stretch it but barely.

# Howto make

 Moulding Depron

The problem with depron is, that it does not behave like an ordinairy sheet of plastic that you can vacu-form. It will immediately go out of shape when it is heated. It will warp, get thicker, more brittle, and shrink its length and width. All this is due to the fact that there are countless isolated, gas-filled cells in it. When you heat depron, the heated gas wants to expand desperately. As soon as the base material becomes soft enough this expanding will immediately begin, with all those unwanted side effects. Thats why you must enclose the depron on all sides, when you heat it.

The general idea is to shape, wrap, form, a sheet of depron, by hand around a heated wooden core or mould. In fact I cold-crush the depron to shape (without cracking it).Then to wrap clear tape tight around the whole outside (this forces the depron to follow the shape of the mould, and prevents it to increase in thickness in the oven). After this the whole thing must go in the (kitchen)-oven, followed by a cooling off period outside the oven. This controlled heating and cooling fixes the shape of the mould into the depron, and restores the original strength of the depron, that was partially lost when cold-shaping it.

An other problem is that deprons ability to change its shape is much more limited than normal "vacu-formable" plastics. Because of this we have to split the fuselage into more sections and glue these sections together.

A few important hints:

-Use an elecric oven with a good thermostat and indirect heating with air circulation. -Heat the wooden mould in the oven for 20-30 minutes at 90 deg.C -Heat the taped depron-and-mould for 15 minutes at 80-90 deg.C in the oven. -Cool off outside the oven for at least one hour. -Glue depron with (clear) polyurethane glue. if this glue cures too slow, mix it with a little water
