## 3D printed parts 
- Printed at [Shapeways](https://www.shapeways.com/)
- [STL file](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AiynX8wt2X_PkuBkiUyEsvkO_RJhmw) when printing in "Smooth Fine Detail Plastic" (previously "Frosted Ultra Detail"). High-resolution prints, but material brittle.
- [STL file](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AiynX8wt2X_PlpA5nCe68dNXT2Rdqg) when printing in "Black Professional Plastic". Resolution ok, but holes need to be drilled, gear models "inflated" by 0.04 mm to get the desired shape, the gear axis distance reduced by 0.05 mm.
