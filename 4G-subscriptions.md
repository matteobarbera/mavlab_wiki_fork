# 4G Subscriptions

We have 4G data-only subscriptions through the TUDelft. [https://tudelft.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/](https://tudelft.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/): Navigate to `HOME > WORKPLACE AND WORKING ENVIRONMENT > IT WORKPLACE > MOBILE TELEPHONY`

The PUK codes are in storage shelve `4` in a box named `868MHz 4G`. The cards also have a label with a password.

We have the following numbers in the following devices:
```
Router: 097023193588
USB 01: 097023193590
USB 02: 097023193587
```

The data bundle works without problems up to 20GB/month. If this is exceeded, for example if somebody downloads MATLAB through the 4G router, you can log into the following website with the phone number and password from the 868MHz/4G box: [https://www.t-mobile.nl/zakelijk/login](https://www.t-mobile.nl/zakelijk/login). Use the phone number as gebruikersnaam and the password from the card.

In the t-mobile website, navigate to `MB's aanvullen`. There are some options presented with a price tag. However as soon as you click `Toevoegen`, the MB's are added to your account already. No need to pay anything, seems to just work.
