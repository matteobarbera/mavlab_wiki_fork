# Introduction

Validating your research means often, testflying an UAS. For this in 99% of the cases a battery is needed. There are a few thing to keep in mind when using batteries. On this page you can read about just that.

# Charging

In the MAVLab room 0.44 is a big storage cupboard(soonâ„¢) where you can satisfy you battery charging needs. The charging process can be monitored online if your battery has an asset FRID tag. Surf to http://log.mavlab.info/batteries to see your battery status.

# Storage

After having flown your UAS, your day is not yet over. It is time to put your LiPo batteries in storage state. Why? If batteries are not in storage mode and not used for a while in fully charged state, they just break, so for you not to be able to use 'em.

HOW:
* For Bebop, put battery in Storage Charge Device... wait
