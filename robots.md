# Introduction

The TU Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands has a MAVLab. Our Hangar contains various UA. This page is the entry-point to their specifications

# Airframes

* [Nederdrone](../Nederdrone)
* [Cyclone](../drone-cyclone)

The MAVLab department of TU Delft has a lot of experimental aircraft. There are also some "Workhorses", regular UA where only the payload changes. To avoid duplicate information and the effort that comes with maintaining the correct information, [the airframes available in the Lab can be found in this database system ](http://log.mavlab.info/)

Maintenance history and flightlog data also can be found [in the same database](http://log.mavlab.info/)

# Ground equipment

A detailed [Ground equipment page](ground-equipment) page is available to give all in depth information about the ground equipment that can be used with all of these aircraft.
