# Airframes

* [[Nederdrone]]
* [[Cyclone|drone-cyclone]]

The MAVLab department of TU Delft has a lot of experimental aircraft. There are also some "Workhorses", regular UA where only the payload changes. To avoid duplicate information and the effort that comes with maintaining the correct information, [the airframes available in the Lab can be found in this database system ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11HrAAfv4T3KtPxwKYdA7oQk-1KCdCCC9dIENhK8_4cc/edit#gid=2009053226)

Maintenance history and flightlog data should also be recorded in the same database.

# Ground equipment

A detailed [Ground equipment page](ground-equipment) page is available to give all in depth information about the ground equipment that can be used with all of these aircraft.
