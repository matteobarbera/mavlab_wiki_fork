This page contains all information and reference to information related to the technical aspects of the VUTURA project.

The VUTURA demonstration in Delft had 5 drones in it. Three of these were flying using the normal AirMap app. The other two, a Parrot Disco and an Altura X8 AED-drone (with RPi) had onboard software communicating directly with AirMap/Unifly.

## Configuration
