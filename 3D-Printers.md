# Current equipments

The MAVLab is now equipped with three 3D printers: 
* the Ultimaker 3
* the Anycubic Chiron
* the Anycubic Photon (resin printer, restricted access)

The Cura slicer is available at https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura. 

## Ultimaker 3

The Ultimaker 3 printer has a printing volume of **215 x 215 x 200 mm**. Leveling is automatic and printing material must have a diameter of **2.85 mm**. To setup the printer profile on Cura, simply go to `Settings > Printer > Add printer...` and pick up the Ultimaker 3. Recommended print setup should normally be enough for most printings. 

## Anycubic Chiron

The Anycubic Chiron 3D printer offers a large printing volume of **400 x 400 x 450 mm**. It comes with both manual and automatic leveling systems, and requires **1.75 mm diameter** print material like PLA. You can use the [official user manual](https://github.com/tudelft/mavlab/blob/master/pdf/equipment/ANYCUBIC%20Chrion-User%20manual-20180907-V7.pdf) to setup the slicer profile. 

Alternatively, if you are using the Cura slicing software, you can directly import the [Cura profile](https://github.com/tudelft/mavlab/blob/master/scripts/Anycubic_Chiron_Print_Settings.curaprofile). Prior to the printing setup, you will be required to setup your 3D printer on Cura. Since the Anycubic Chiron is not available on the printers list, select the **Prusa i3** basic model and then change the machine settings to get the same as described below.

<b>Using Renkforce PLA Filament?</b>
Print settings depend on the material you are using. If you are using Renkforce PLA filament (1.75 mm), you will need to adjust the print settings. You can either use the [Cura settings for Renkforce](https://github.com/tudelft/mavlab/blob/master/scripts/Anycubic_Chiron_%20Settings_RF_PLA_1.75.curaprofile), or directly set the parameters as follows:
