# Introduction

 * [[Introduction]] for newcomers, a **must read** if you want to have success in the MAVLab
 * If you are graduating at C&S also look [here](http://cswiki.lr.tudelft.nl/students/graduation)

# Lab standards

Soaring free like an eagle :eagle: would be our main motto. One small kink, if you soar in the lab, you need to adhere to some standards. That is good thing, since it will save you time along the way.

## Papers :page_facing_up:

 * When writing papers and you want to publish, first go through the [Publishing checklist](publishchecklist) to see if you document adheres to the lab standard

## Ordering :euro:

 * If you order anything, you **must** read the [finance rules](rules-finance) first.

## Common

 * [Read about the standards in the MAVLab for hardware, software and whatnot...](Lab-standards)

## Flight Operations Manuals :books:

 * If you want to operate **indoor**, [go to these OPS pages](http://www.github.com/tudelft/Operations)
 * If you want to operate **outdoor**, [read about it on the OPS pages](http://www.github.com/tudelft/Operations)

# Tutorials :beginner:

Tutorials are best published publicly on e.g. http://wiki.paparazziuav.org. If it is of internal use only or not useful at all of others one could consider to make a specific page in this wiki.

* Install arm-none-eabi-gdb. [â€‹A tutorial to do this can be found here](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.13/tutorials/EmbeddedProgramming/stm32.html)

# Demo :baby_chick:

To promote the Lab nd TU Delft research in general, demoing various drones in operation to 3rd parties is of help

The following can be demo'ed out of the box:

* Crazyflie location
* Damage Drone recovery
* Delfly Nimble
* Delftacopter

Add more if you have demoable setups
