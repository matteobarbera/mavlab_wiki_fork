# Introduction

 * [[Introduction]] for newcomers, a **must read** if you want to have success in the MAVLab
 * If you are graduating at C&S also look [here](http://cswiki.lr.tudelft.nl/students/graduation)

# Lab standards

<img src="../raw/master/photos/standards/standards_comic_01.gif" width="75%"/>

Soaring free like an eagle :eagle: would be our main motto. One small kink, if you soar in the lab, you need to adhere to some standards. That is good thing, since it will save you time along the way.

## Papers :page_facing_up:

 * When writing papers and you want to publish, first go through the [Publishing checklist](publishchecklist) to see if you document adheres to the lab standard

## Ordering :euro:

 * If you order anything, you **must** read the [finance rules](rules-finance) first.

## Common

 * [Read about the standards in the MAVLab for hardware, software and whatnot...](Lab-standards)

## Flight Operations Manuals :books:

 * If you want to operate your flying device **indoor**, [go to these OPS pages](http://www.github.com/tudelft/Operations)
 * If you want to operate your flying device **outdoor**, [read about it on the OPS pages](http://www.github.com/tudelft/Operations)

## Wiki

 * The markup of the MAVLab wiki should be in MARKDOWN format
 * [Links should be RELATIVE Links](relative-links-in-wiki) if the information is contained _inside this wiki_.

# Projects :timer_clock:

<img src="../raw/master/photos/standards/project_comic_01.gif" width="75%"/>

 * [Here in Trello you find the most up to date list](https://trello.com/b/FelPdV49/mavlab-overview) of people and projects

# Courses :man_technologist:

 * Paparazzi Vision Based Control [Website](https://tudelft.github.io/coursePaparazzi/) and [Source](https://github.com/tudelft/coursePaparazzi) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_KSX9GOn2P_LUXJOQxc6PLr7c7eTUs98)
 * [Optic Flow Notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/guidoAI/optic_flow_control_notebook.git/master)

# Robots :robot:

 * Our [[robots]] or call 'em airframes if you like
 * [[The Delfly Family]]

# Batteries

It is that most batteries could just burst in flames if not handled correctly. So a must-read [whole chapter about proper charging, handling and storage of Batteries](batteries)

# Chemicals :boom:

Building things and need specific chemicals, e.g. quality epoxy, then [this page might be of help](chemicals)

# Equipment :wrench:

<img src="../raw/master/photos/standards/equipment_comic_01.gif" width="75%"/>

Building nifty devices and need tools, [read about all the tools at your disposal here](equipment)

# Tutorials :beginner:

<img src="../raw/master/photos/standards/courses_comic_01.gif" width="75%"/>

Tutorials are best published publicly on e.g. http://wiki.paparazziuav.org. If it is of internal use only or not useful at all of others one could consider to make a specific page in this wiki.

## Internal tutorials

* BLheli flashing

## External

* Crimping connectors https://iotexpert.com/2018/01/18/jst-connector-crimping-insanity/
* Install arm-none-eabi-gdb. [â€‹A tutorial to do this can be found here](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.13/tutorials/EmbeddedProgramming/stm32.html)

# SmartUAV

SmartUAV is a UAV simulation platform developed by the MavLab to investigate Many aspects of UAV implementation. It provides a framework to do research into all areas of UAV development ranging from advanced Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) to investigate Human Machine Interaction (HMI) to novel vision based control and guidance algorithms. Being designed and maintained in-house, SmartUAV can be altered and updated as the user requires.

[Read all about how to use it to your research advantage on the SamartUAV page](SmartUAV)

# Demo's

<img src="../raw/master/photos/standards/demo_comic_01.gif" width="75%"/>

To promote _the_ Lab and TU Delft research in general, demoing various drones in operation to 3rd parties is of help

The following can be demo'ed out of the box:

Working  Name
- [ ] [Crazyflie localization](Demo-Crazyflie-localization)
- [ ] [Damaged Drone recovery](Demo-Damaged-Drone-Recovery)
- [ ] [Delfly Nimble](Demo-Delfly-Nimble)
- [ ] [Delftacopter](Demo-Delftacopter)

Add more if you have demoable setups
